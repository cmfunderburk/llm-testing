### Phase 1: Core Architecture

#### Completed
- [2026-01-12] FEAT-001: Multi-Head Attention Module - Implemented with causal masking, scaled dot-product attention, and educational comments explaining QKV projections and scaling factor
- [2026-01-12] FEAT-002: Feed-Forward Network - Implemented with GELU activation and 4x expansion factor, comments explain why FFN follows attention
- [2026-01-12] FEAT-003: Transformer Block - Pre-norm architecture with residual connections, comments explain pre-norm vs post-norm choice
- [2026-01-12] FEAT-004: GPT Model - Full model with token/position embeddings, N transformer blocks, output projection. Parameter count calculation included
- [2026-01-12] FEAT-005: BPE Tokenizer - tiktoken wrapper with GPT-2 vocabulary (50,257 tokens), encode/decode/tokenize methods
- [2026-01-12] FEAT-006: Data Pipeline - Sliding window dataset with configurable stride, train/val split, corpus registry

#### Issues Encountered
- None

#### Verification Results
- MultiHeadAttention: (2, 128, 768) input -> (2, 128, 768) output
- FeedForward: (2, 128, 256) input -> (2, 128, 256) output
- TransformerBlock: (2, 128, 256) input -> (2, 128, 256) output
- GPTModel (nano): (2, 64) input -> (2, 64, 50257) logits, ~30.5M params
- Tokenizer: encode("Hello world") -> [15496, 995] -> "Hello world"
- DataLoader: verdict corpus, batch_size=4, context_length=64 -> shapes correct

#### Files Created
- experiments/pretraining/model.py - GPT model implementation
- experiments/pretraining/config.py - Model configurations (nano, small, medium)
- experiments/pretraining/tokenizer.py - BPE tokenizer wrapper
- experiments/pretraining/data.py - Data pipeline
