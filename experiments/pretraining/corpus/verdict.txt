THE VERDICT


I

Jack Dodd, the art critic, on his way to Dodd's New York studio, had
met Mark Dodd's servant on the ground floor of the building and found
the man somewhat pale.

"I'm glad you've come, Mr. Dodd," the servant said. "Mr. Dodd has
been very much upset by a letter."

"A letter? What kind of letter?" The critic's curiosity was instantly
alert.

The servant hesitated. "I can't say, sir; but it seems to have disturbed
him."

Jack Dodd went up the stairs thoughtfully. His brother had not been
well of late, and the critic was easily anxious about him.

The studio door was open, and Jack walked in without knocking. The big
lofty room, with its north light and its crowded canvases, was empty;
but from the inner room, which served as a combination of bed-room
and breakfast-room, came the sound of agitated walking.

"Hello, Mark!" Jack called out.

The walking stopped, and Mark Dodd appeared in the doorway. He was a
tall thin man with a fine head and nervous hands.

"Hello, Jack! I'm glad you've come. I've got something to show you."

"So I understand. Peters tells me you've had a disturbing letter."

"A letter? Oh yes, that. But something else has happened since then.
Come in here."

Jack followed him into the inner room, and Mark pointed to the wall
above the fireplace. On it hung a small picture—a portrait apparently
—which Jack did not remember to have seen there before.

"When did that come?" he asked.

"This morning. It was delivered just after the letter. And that's what
I want you to see."

Jack walked up to the picture and examined it curiously. It represented
a young woman, in the simple dress of a bygone day, seated in a high
carved chair against a background of dark drapery.

"A pleasant little thing," he said. "French, I should say, about 1820.
Who is she?"

Mark Dodd laughed nervously. "That's just the point. I don't know.
I've never seen her before. And yet there's something about her that
seems familiar."

"Familiar? In what way?"

Mark hesitated. "I can't tell you. It's just an impression—a feeling.
But when I look at that face I seem to be trying to remember something."

Jack scrutinized the portrait more closely. The face was gentle and
appealing, with soft dark eyes and a sensitive mouth.

"I don't see anything remarkable about it," he said at length. "A
pretty girl of the period—one of a hundred. Who sent it to you?"

"That's the odd part. There's no indication. It came by express, with
my name and address, but no sender's card. And the letter that came
before it was signed only with initials that I don't recognize."

"What did the letter say?"

"Very little. Just a few lines asking me to examine this portrait
carefully and tell the writer what I think of it. I'm to address my
answer to a post office box."

Jack smiled. "Some crank who wants a free opinion."

"Perhaps. But there's something about the whole business that makes
me uneasy. Why this mysterious approach? Why send the picture without
any explanation?"

"Publicity scheme, perhaps. Or someone trying to sell a picture and
thinking this is a clever way to arouse your interest."

"Maybe. But I wish I could remember where I've seen that face before."

The brothers stood side by side, gazing at the portrait. The painted
eyes looked back at them with their soft inscrutable expression.

"Well," said Jack at length, "what are you going to do about it?"

"I'm going to study it. I'm going to try to find out who she was, and
why her face haunts me. There's a mystery here, and I mean to solve it."


II

A week passed, and Jack heard nothing more from his brother. Then one
evening Mark called him on the telephone.

"Can you come over? I've found out something."

Jack found his brother in the studio, standing before the portrait with
a curious expression on his face.

"Well?" said Jack.

"I've been doing some research," Mark said slowly. "This portrait was
painted by a French artist named Doré—not the famous Gustave Doré, but
a lesser-known portrait painter of the same period. He worked in Paris
in the early nineteenth century."

"And the subject?"

"That's where it gets interesting. According to the records I've been
able to find, this portrait was commissioned by a wealthy American
named William Gisburn. It was painted in Paris in 1822."

"Gisburn? Never heard of him."

"Neither had I. But I did some more digging. William Gisburn was a
successful merchant who made his fortune in the shipping trade. He
lived in New York but traveled frequently to Europe."

"And the woman in the portrait?"

Mark paused. "Her name was Marie-Claire Beaumont. She was a French
actress, quite famous in her day. Gisburn fell in love with her during
one of his trips to Paris. He commissioned this portrait as a memento."

"A love affair, then. That explains the portrait. But why would someone
send it to you?"

"That's what I haven't figured out yet. But there's more. After some
months, Gisburn returned to New York. Marie-Claire was to follow him,
but she never arrived. Her ship was lost at sea."

"How tragic."

"Yes. And Gisburn never recovered from the loss. He became a recluse,
refusing to see anyone. The portrait was the only reminder he kept of her."

Jack studied his brother's face. "You've become quite invested in this
story."

"I can't help it. There's something about that face—" Mark broke off,
shaking his head. "I feel as if I'm being drawn into something I don't
understand."


III

The mystery deepened as the weeks went by. Mark spent hours researching
the history of William Gisburn and Marie-Claire Beaumont. He discovered
that Gisburn had lived to a great age, dying in 1890 at the age of
ninety-two. He had never married, never formed another attachment.

"The portrait was sold at auction after his death," Mark told Jack
one afternoon. "It changed hands several times over the years. The
last recorded sale was in 1950, to a private collector whose name
was not disclosed."

"And now it's here, in your studio."

"Yes. And I still don't know why. The letter that accompanied it was
signed only with the initials 'M.C.' I've tried everything to trace
the sender, but I've had no success."

Jack was thoughtful. "M.C. Marie-Claire?"

Mark laughed, but there was no humor in it. "That's impossible. She
died in 1823. Unless you believe in ghosts."

"I don't. But someone wanted you to have this portrait. Someone with
a connection to Marie-Claire, perhaps?"

"That's what I've been thinking. But who? And why?"

The portrait hung on the wall, the painted eyes as inscrutable as ever.
Jack studied it again, trying to see what his brother saw, trying to
understand the fascination it held for him.

"She was beautiful," he said at last. "In a quiet, understated way."

"Yes," Mark agreed. "There's something about her expression—a kind of
waiting, as if she's expecting something. Or someone."

They stood in silence for a long moment. Then Mark spoke again.

"I received another letter today."

Jack looked at him sharply. "From the same person?"

"The same initials. M.C. This time, the letter asked me a question."

"What question?"

Mark reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded sheet of paper.
He handed it to Jack, who read the single line written on it:

"Do you remember me now?"

Jack felt a chill run down his spine. "What does it mean?"

"I don't know," Mark said quietly. "But I'm beginning to think I need
to find out. There's something in my past—something I've forgotten—
that connects me to this woman. To this portrait."

The brothers looked at each other, and then at the portrait on the wall.
The painted eyes seemed to hold a secret, a truth that hovered just out
of reach.

"I'm going to find out," Mark said. "Whatever it takes, I'm going to
solve this mystery."

And the portrait gazed back at them, silent and serene, keeping its
secrets as it had for nearly two hundred years.
