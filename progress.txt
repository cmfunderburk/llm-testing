### Iteration 1 - Ralph Loop Started
- Reading PRD-LLM-LEARNING-LAB.json and DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md
- Phase 1 entry criteria verified: VISION.md exists, test_finetune.py exists
- Beginning Phase 1: Infrastructure & Foundation
- Working on FEAT-001: Codebase Restructure

### Phase 1 Complete
- FEAT-001: Codebase Restructure - DONE
  - Created experiments/ directory structure
  - Created experiments/__init__.py, experiments/fine_tuning/__init__.py
  - Created experiments/fine_tuning/basic_qlora.py (learning-focused training script)
  - Created README.md reflecting learning lab purpose
  - Verified: `python -c "import experiments"` works

- FEAT-002: Documentation Framework - DONE
  - Created docs/concepts/ directory
  - Created docs/concepts/TEMPLATE.md (concept documentation template)
  - Created docs/concepts/qlora.md (example concept doc)
  - Verified: `test -d docs/concepts` passes

- FEAT-003: Questions Log - DONE
  - Created QUESTIONS.md with questions from VISION.md
  - Format supports status tracking (OPEN/EXPLORING/ANSWERED/SUPERSEDED)
  - Per-experiment question convention documented
  - Verified: `test -f QUESTIONS.md` passes

- FEAT-004: Experiment Template - DONE
  - Created experiments/EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE.py with full structure
  - Template includes: hypothesis, methodology, results, learnings sections
  - Updated basic_qlora.py to include RESULTS and LEARNINGS sections
  - Verified: grep finds 'hypothesis' in experiment files

Phase 1 EXIT CRITERIA MET:
- Codebase restructured to experiments/ focus
- docs/concepts/ exists with template
- QUESTIONS.md initialized
- First instrumented experiment ready to run

STOPPING: Per instructions, asking for approval before Phase 2
