THE VERDICT


I

Jack Dodd, the art critic, on his way to Dodd's New York studio, had
met Mark Dodd's servant on the ground floor of the building and found
the man somewhat pale.

"I'm glad you've come, Mr. Dodd," the servant said. "Mr. Dodd has
been very much upset by a letter."

"A letter? What kind of letter?" The critic's curiosity was instantly
alert.

The servant hesitated. "I can't say, sir; but it seems to have disturbed
him."

Jack Dodd went up the stairs thoughtfully. His brother had not been
well of late, and the critic was easily anxious about him.

The studio door was open, and Jack walked in without knocking. The big
lofty room, with its north light and its crowded canvases, was empty;
but from the inner room, which served as a combination of bed-room
and breakfast-room, came the sound of agitated walking.

"Hello, Mark!" Jack called out.

The walking stopped, and Mark Dodd appeared in the doorway. He was a
tall thin man with a fine head and nervous hands.

"Hello, Jack! I'm glad you've come. I've got something to show you."

"So I understand. Peters tells me you've had a disturbing letter."

"A letter? Oh yes, that. But something else has happened since then.
Come in here."

Jack followed him into the inner room, and Mark pointed to the wall
above the fireplace. On it hung a small picture—a portrait apparently
—which Jack did not remember to have seen there before.

"When did that come?" he asked.

"This morning. It was delivered just after the letter. And that's what
I want you to see."

Jack walked up to the picture and examined it curiously. It represented
a young woman, in the simple dress of a bygone day, seated in a high
carved chair against a background of dark drapery.

"A pleasant little thing," he said. "French, I should say, about 1820.
Who is she?"

Mark Dodd laughed nervously. "That's just the point. I don't know.
I've never seen her before. And yet there's something about her that
seems familiar."

"Familiar? In what way?"

Mark hesitated. "I can't tell you. It's just an impression—a feeling.
But when I look at that face I seem to be trying to remember something."

Jack scrutinized the portrait more closely. The face was gentle and
appealing, with soft dark eyes and a sensitive mouth.

"I don't see anything remarkable about it," he said at length. "A
pretty girl of the period—one of a hundred. Who sent it to you?"

"That's the odd part. There's no indication. It came by express, with
my name and address, but no sender's card. And the letter that came
before it was signed only with initials that I don't recognize."

"What did the letter say?"

"Very little. Just a few lines asking me to examine this portrait
carefully and tell the writer what I think of it. I'm to address my
answer to a post office box."

Jack smiled. "Some crank who wants a free opinion."

"Perhaps. But there's something about the whole business that makes
me uneasy. Why this mysterious approach? Why send the picture without
any explanation?"

"Publicity scheme, perhaps. Or someone trying to sell a picture and
thinking this is a clever way to arouse your interest."

"Maybe. But I wish I could remember where I've seen that face before."

The brothers stood side by side, gazing at the portrait. The painted
eyes looked back at them with their soft inscrutable expression.

"Well," said Jack at length, "what are you going to do about it?"

"I'm going to study it. I'm going to try to find out who she was, and
why her face haunts me. There's a mystery here, and I mean to solve it."
